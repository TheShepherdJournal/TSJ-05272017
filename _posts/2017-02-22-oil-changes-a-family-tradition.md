When it comes learning life skills, my education was not what most people would call conventional. My father was not much of a handyman, but was a master in the kitchen. My mother didn’t cook much, even though she could, and knew which end of the hammer to hold.

From my parents I learned how to do light carpentry, paint a house, and bake a cake. However, I learned the first two from my mother, and the latter from my father. I also learned a love for fishing...from my mom.

Don’t get me wrong, my dad was a good man. I learned a lot about patience, and how to treat other people from him. He rarely got angry, and I never heard him curse. And ever present with the man was his cup of coffee.

I was the youngest in my family, and by the time I got to high school, I was an “only child.” I did many things by myself. But if I asked, my dad was willing to tag along and keep me company. And that’s where the picture you see comes from.

When I was in high school I got my first car. And wanting to do the “manly” thing, I decided to change my own oil. Now this was in the days before YouTube, so I did what any young blooded American boy would do, I asked my mother how to do it. She gave me very good instructions, and I went out and purchased what I needed to get the job done.

As I was getting things together, my father decided to come out and “help.” In my family, this meant he was going to supervise, drinking coffee. So, he set up a lawn chair and settled in with his coffee, leaving all the dirty work to me.

My father passed away before my children were old enough to know him. So all they have are pictures and my stories. When my son decided to change his own oil for the first time, I saw an opportunity to get both for him. So, we recreated that scene from my senior year, and thus preserved not only a memory, but a legacy.
