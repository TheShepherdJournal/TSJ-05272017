The Maple Syrup Festival is coming soon and the Shepherd Rotary Club will again sponsor the most unique way to spend $5 in Shepherd. For the 10th year, we will pay $500 to whomever has the square that a cow (now a horse) dumps on!

This fundraiser was inspired by a similar event run by the Breckenridge Rotary Club. We organized “Cow Patty Bingo” as part of the Shepherd Sesquicentennial in 2007, and then it became a regular at the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival beginning in 2008. The event has been held at the Shepherd United Methodist Church since 2009.

We had a significant mishap with Cow Patty Bingo at the Family Fun Festival in June of 2009. A beautiful heifer loaned to us by the Joe Bryant family escaped and died while being recaptured. The Bryant family was very gracious, be we questioned whether we could or should continue this type of fundraiser. We ended up switching from cows to horses (supplied by Harold Metcalf) and renamed the raffle “Barnyard Bingo.” It has continued as such until this year, as we have renamed it “Road Apple Raffle” to remove any question as to whether it was a bingo game or a raffle.

This event has been a very successful fundraiser for the Rotary Club, clearing over $2000 each year for mostly local projects. As we say, “we will have some fun, you might win $500, and at the least you are helping do good in the community.” We look forward to your continuing support.
