In early January, Hanson Hardware owner Brian Hanson posted the following:
<blockquote>After 52 years of selling hardware, the last 34 in Shepherd, I have decided to try a new career better known as retirement! It is with regret that I leave the many loyal people who have chosen to become not just customers but friends. It is also with regret that I leave the last 2 of the many men and women who have helped this business not only survive but prosper.

The daily contact with all of you will be missed. My plans are to stay in Shepherd because this is home. To all of you I say a huge thank-you!! Now for the business side, stock reduction sales start Jan. 3 with 10% off entire stock with increasing weekly reductions. There is no definite closing date but sometime around the end of February or early March is the target. Once again, thank-you one and all. You have all enriched my life!</blockquote>
I’m going to miss having a Hardware store in town. I’m not a frequent shopper there, but when we’ve needed a part or a tool it was a life saver to have some place to go that was so close. And, there is just something more welcoming about a locally owned business that you can’t get at the big box stores.

I stopped by the Hardware Store a few weeks ago and talked to Brian. We talked a lot about how much Shepherd has changed in the 34 years that his store has been business. Especially the businesses that have come and gone.

I wanted to wish Brian the best as he gets closer to shutting his doors for good on the store, and begins a new chapter in his life.
