<em>Via the Shepherd High School</em>

Announcements for Thursday, February 23rd, 2017:
<ul>
 	<li>This is a reminder for book club members that there is a meeting tomorrow in Mrs. Grim's room at lunch to discuss The Fixer.</li>
 	<li>The Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival Royalty Pageant registration ends Friday, February 24th. Stop in to the counseling office for the application and informational packet.</li>
 	<li>Any girl interested in playing soccer this spring needs to sign up in the high school office. The first day of practice for spring sports is Monday, March 13th and you must have had an athletic physical before you will be allowed to participate in practice or competitions.</li>
 	<li>Students: Please check your home page of your Chromebook and you will find a survey from our elementary school. This is a quick, 2 question, survey to find out what was your favorite childhood picture and chapter book. They are building a book bracket (think March Madness) to fire their kids up about reading.</li>
</ul>
