The Shepherd Community Friends of the Library are hosting their annual one-day motorcoach tour on Saturday, August 5, and all community members are invited to go along for the ride.

This yearâ€™s destination is Traverse City, with tours of the Village at Grand Traverse Commons, the Music House Museum, and the GT Butterfly House and Bug Zoo. The Village at Grand Traverse Commons is a unique redevelopment of dozens of historic buildings formerly known as the Traverse City State Hospital. It is one of the largest historic rehabilitation and adaptive reuse development projects in the nation. Our guided one-hour tour requires moderate walking; then we will have lunch, wander at our leisure, and visit shops selling first-edition books, home goods, clothing, Christmas items and more.

The Music House Museum houses a one-of-a-kind collection of rare antique musical instruments and music-making machines dating from the late 1700s through 1950. Tours showcase beauty and craftsmanship, the history of the era and the engineering complexity of the collection. We will see and hear a Belgian dance organ, Wurlitzer Theater Organ, nickelodeons, music boxes displayed in authentic period settings and a unique musical gift shop. At the GT Butterfly House and Bug Zoo, the sheer number &amp; variety of butterflies from all over the planet is astounding, and at the Bug Zoo we will visit bugs, spiders, frogs, and surprises like a beehive that is in a clear casing with an exit pipe so the bees fly outside to get real flowers and nectar. If spiders are not your thing, you can easily avoid this area.

The trip includes deluxe roundtrip motorcoach transportation, a guided tour of the Village at Grand Traverse Commons, lunch, time on our own for shopping at GT Commons, admission to and guided tour of the Music House Museum, and admission to GT Butterfly House &amp; Bug Zoo.

The cost is $100.00 per person, and full payment of $100.00 per person reserves your spot. Pick-up locations are:
